In this chapter we establish a common background for serverless computing and WebAssembly.

\section{Serverless computing}

\subsection{Function-as-a-Service}

\begin{quote}
    \quot{Serverless computing is an emerging cloud-based execution model in which user-defined functions are seamlessly and transparently hosted and managed by a distributed platform. \cite{Nastic2017}}
\end{quote}

Most developers know serverless computing in the form of Function-as-a-Service (FaaS). The major cloud providers have FaaS offerings such as Amazon Web Services's (AWS) Lambdas, Google Cloud Functions, Microsoft Azure Functions or IBM Cloud Functions. They seamlessly and transparently host the functions for the users without them having to actively manage scaling or administer infrastructure. \citeauthor{Fox2017} point out, that these offerings are more appropriately described as »server-hidden«, since these platforms hide how functions are run or how scaling is done and since there are not \emph{no} servers, but rather, hidden ones. They see serverless as a natural evolution from running applications on bare metal, then in virtual machines, later in containers and now as functions. They point to the convenience of the application developer not having to worry about provisioning infrastructure and the associated scalability concerns, as the major advantage of serverless \cite{Fox2017}. \citeauthor{Castro2019} observe a similar perspective: serverless is the successor to Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) such as Google's App Engine. But it improves on PaaS by charging users only for what they use -- the »pay-as-you-go« model \cite{Castro2019}.
As much as serverless is an evolution of one area of cloud computing, it is an addition to others. Functions are essentially stateless -- and they have to be programmed with that context in mind, due to their nature of potentially being destroyed and re-created at any given time. Since pure functions by themselves are not very useful, they are often combined with other offerings of the Everything-as-a-Service model, such as databases or event buses. One concrete example is AWS AppSync\footnote{\url{https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/}}, a managed GraphQL API. The serverless AWS Lambdas can resolve fields of a GraphQL type, for example, by querying multiple databases at once. This can act as a replacement for the traditional monolithic web server to implementing backend APIs.

\citeauthor{McGrath2017} describe serverless as the manifestation of the idea, that applications are defined by events and the actions they trigger \cite{McGrath2017}. Events can be a rule firing, a file being uploaded to a storage system or an edge device measuring sensor data and posting it via HTTP. If many events occur at once, the serverless platform is able to scale-up to meet the demand. Serverless is also ideal if no events occur, because no cost for the user is incurred. Serverless platforms are able to offer that, because they follow the scale-to-zero principle: functions that are not used do not take up resources.

\subsection{Serverless architecture}

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics{figures/ServerlessArchitecture.pdf}
    \caption{A generalized serverless architecture based on OpenWhisk, OpenFaaS and OpenLambda.}
    \label{fig:serverless-architecture}
\end{figure}

Based on popular open-source serverless frameworks we can infer what a typical serverless architecture looks like. We use OpenFaaS\footnote{\url{https://www.openfaas.com/}}, Apache OpenWhisk\footnote{\url{https://openwhisk.apache.org/}} and OpenLambda\footnote{\url{https://github.com/open-lambda/open-lambda}} as our basis. We sketched this generalized architecture in figure \ref{fig:serverless-architecture}. The system is exposed through an API Gateway. A user can interact with the system through the gateway and manage (i.e. CRUD) functions, set up scheduled triggers or retrieve the results of previous invocations. Once a function is created and an execution request comes in, the load balancer will pick an appropriate host for execution. Each of these runs a sandboxing execution engine, such as Docker or a similar container runtime which runs user workloads in an isolated manner.
Serverless frameworks allow developers to write their functions in a variety of languages; they are almost language-agnostic. Since many popular languages need a runtime, such as \inl{node.js}, \inl{Python} or a \inl{JRE}, these runtimes are baked into container images. In order to execute a function, the container image with the appropriate runtime is pulled from a container registry.
The functions' code is retrieved from an internal database. The container is started, the code is injected and made ready for execution. Finally, the function is invoked with the user's parameters and the result returned to the framework, which in turn returns it to the user. Typically, frameworks implement optimizations such as pre-pulling images onto the hosts or keeping started containers around for some time, to avoid the costly first startup on subsequent invocations. Here we see a discrepancy between the aforementioned ideal of scaling to zero and the real world implementations. If post-invocation containers are still running but users are no longer billed for them, then the cost will fall to the framework operator. An ideal framework would be truly scale-to-zero, but there is one issue that prevents them from being so.

\subsection{Cold Start}

In the context of serverless computing, a cold start refers to the invocation of a function, when all of the necessary resources for its execution must be provisioned from scratch. A cold start thus delays the execution of the function itself, by the amount of time it takes for the resources to become ready. This is what we call the cold start latency or cold start time. \citeauthor{Wang2018} have measured the cold start latency at major cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform. The cold start time depends on the allocated memory, from which the CPU allowance is determined, so they are given as well. The median cold start latency for AWS was between 250 ms (1536 MB) and 265 ms (128 MB) and between 110 ms (2048 MB) and 493 ms (128 MB) for Google, both depending on the amount of memory assigned to the instance \cite{Wang2018}.

Cold starts prevent serverless platforms from scaling to zero in practice. If every function would be executed in a newly provisioned container, subsequent invocations of the same function would all incur the cold start debt and would not be performant enough. Thus, typical optimizations are to keep these resources provisioned, such that repeated requests are faster to execute. Apache OpenWhisk, for instance, keeps a functions container paused and ready for reuse for 10 minutes, before removing it entirely. AWS Lambda's cold start policy has been reverse-engineered and the findings indicate that an instance stays alive for a duration of 5 to 7 minutes, during which no cold start will take place \cite{ShilCold2021}.

Cold starts are an issue for latency-sensitive applications, where additional hundreds of milliseconds are unacceptable. \citeauthor{Cui2018} gives examples such as food ordering services, e-commerce sites or social networks, which all have unpredictable bursts of requests at certain points in time. In serverless versions of these applications, these bursts would translate into multiple concurrent cold starts, of which each individual one is slower than a singular, non-concurrent cold start. Thus, the numbers cited above increase significantly with higher concurrency (\cite{Mohan2019, Cui2018}) -- something that auto-scaling platforms ought to handle particularly well.

\subsection{Serverless Edge Computing}

With the growing number of IoT devices, we're \quot{entering the post-cloud era}, as \citeauthor{Shi2016} write. The edge computing paradigm promises to be a solution to the massive amounts of data that will be generated at the edge. A wearable body sensor measuring health data for example, can use the wearer's smartphone (edge device) for data processing rather than sending the workload all the way to the cloud. In general, edge devices are machines that sit between the data source and the cloud. This processing close to the data source has a number of advantages, such as enabling low latency response times as well as working with privacy-sensitive data. This is necessary, since sending all data to the cloud has comparably higher latency and puts more strain on the network \cite{Shi2016}.

One piece of the puzzle towards realizing this paradigm, is serverless edge computing. \citeauthor{Aslanpour2021} lay out the vision for serverless edge computing, of which we highlight two points.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Due to IoT devices' unpredictable workload, an under- or overprovisioning of static resources such as VMs or containers would be likely. Serverless with its ability to scale to zero (even with above's caveat) provides more precise provisioning of resources and only incurs cost when used, bringing advantages for operator and user, respectively. Executing serverless workloads in an energy-constrained setting, such as on single-board computers (SBC), this becomes doubly-important.
    \item Serverless computing tends to be used for unpredictable, bursty workloads that require immediate up-scaling. Application architectures for IoT devices are usually event-driven and often unpredictable, making them a perfect fit for serverless \cite{Aslanpour2021}.
\end{itemize}

Serverless computing can be the enabler for edge computing. But some of its original design decisions need to be reexamined, as \citeauthor{Nastic2018} point out, due to the

\begin{quote}
    \quot{[...] inherently different nature of Edge infrastructure, for example, in terms of available resources, network, geographical hyper-distribution, very large scale, etc. \cite{Nastic2018}}
\end{quote}

IBM has reacted to these changed requirements and introduced Edge Functions on the IBM Cloud Internet Services. This offering allows developers to run code closer to the user by deploying functions to their edge network. As a consequence of the resource constraints of edge devices, their offering uses the JavaScript V8 engine and its isolates feature. This is a similar step as moving to a WebAssembly executor, i.e. using a less costly sandboxing mechanism than containers to account for the resource constraints on the edge. Some of their serverless edge computing use cases include »personalized user experiences through conditional routing and originless responses« or increased API responsiveness through aggregation and caching from multiple cloud-based API endpoints \cite{Farid2019}.

\subsection{Serverless workload}
\label{section:serverless_workload}

Since we aim to redesign the fundamental building block of a serverless framework, it is important to examine what the serverless workload looks like. Here we provide an overview of the research in this area.

\citeauthor{Shahrad2020} have characterized the serverless workload for a large cloud platform: Microsoft Azure. Because of their large number of users, this study can be considered a very good representation of the average workload.
They find that, on average, 81\% of the functions are invoked less than once per minute. However, those accessed more frequently make up 99.6\% of all invocations \cite{Shahrad2020}.
Those frequently accessed functions should thus be kept in memory, to avoid the cold start entirely. The less frequently accessed functions should not be kept in memory, but created, executed and destroyed immediately, in order to save resources. For this to be viable, the cold-start needs to be a cheap operation. In general, the cheaper the cold start, the smaller the amount of time that functions need to be kept in memory.
Customers are only billed for the execution time of the function in FaaS. Operators bear the cost of keeping functions in memory -- or resources warm, more generally. Thus, shorter cold starts reduce costs.

\citeauthor{Shahrad2020} also find that on average, 50\% of functions execute for less than one second.

\begin{quote}
    \quot{The main implication is that the function execution times are at the same order of magnitude as the cold start times reported for major providers. \emph{This makes avoiding and/or optimizing cold starts extremely important for the overall performance of a FaaS offering} \cite{Shahrad2020}.}
\end{quote}

This is corroborated by the cited cold start times of \citeauthor{Wang2018} above.
Because of these findings, the primary goal in this work is that of reducing the cold start latency, to make cold starts a more efficient process in turn enabling reduced keep-alive times. It would then also make the first of a series of function invocations less costly. Moreover, a single more efficient cold start also reduces the cost of concurrent ones -- a particularly time intensive process for Docker containers.
Even in light of a cheap cold start, we still need to make sure that what we have a resource-efficient way to keep the function in memory. Consider that the most frequently accessed functions make up the overwhelming share of invocations. This scenario needs to be just as efficient as a cold start and it is unlikely that we achieve a reduction of cold start times to such a degree, that always cold starting these functions will be more efficient than a short keep-alive period.
As \citeauthor{Shahrad2020} point out, there is a fundamental trade-off between using memory to keep functions warm, and forgoing it, but incurring the additional latency due to the cold start. Thus, unless we can eliminate the cold start completely, we will need some kind of keep-alive policy. Hence we note it as a requirement for the implementation and also examine the memory usage of our approach in the evaluation.

\citeauthor{Eismann2021} conducted a study on why companies adopt serverless, for which applications it is best-suited and how they are implemented. They analyzed 89 open-source serverless applications, of which 84\% have bursty workloads. Thus, these spikes in demand -- manifested in concurrent requests, in turn causing up-scaling \todo{Is it correct to speak of up-scaling, or should it be out-scaling? Serverless platforms can scale both vertically and horizontally, so it is unclear to me what the correct term is. All I'm trying to say is that more containers will be started as a result of concurrent requests.} -- ought to be handled well by serverless platforms.
They find 69\% of the applications have a data volume of less than 10 MB. Thus, memory-bound applications are likely not a primary use case. Furthermore, 39\% of the applications have a high traffic intensity, 47\% have a low traffic intensity and 17\% utilize scheduled functions. Thus, the latter combined 64\% represent on-demand scenarios where the platform will experience cold starts, since it is less likely that a warm function exists in those cases. According to the authors, 88\% of the applications make use of Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) offerings. Storage, databases and messaging services are the most popular ones \cite{Eismann2021}. Hence, the majority of functions will make requests to external services, which means those functions will frequently wait for network I/O to complete while the CPU is not actively utilized. More generally, network-I/O-bound workloads are a primary type that serverless platforms should be able to handle well.

\section{WebAssembly}

% - origins (asm.js)
% - first implemented in browsers, targeted at web
% - but standalone runtimes exist, similar to V8 which was the node.js runtime for Chrome and later became node.js
% - now also used at cloud service providers for serverless functions (fastly, cloudflare) and as the VM for smart contracts implementation, for instance in IOTA. In all three of these cases security is quite important, as untrusted code is executed.
% - security properties of Wasm
% - Finally, speed is also important (whole reason why asm.js was made in the first place)
% - to use outside of the browser, need a interface to the OS, the task that is done by the browser on the web platform

For the longest time, JavaScript was the sole client-side language in web browsers. With the rising popularity of the web platform and its growing number of APIs, more and more complex web apps were written and sometimes in other programming languages. Necessarily, these languages had to treat JavaScript as a target format, like Java bytecode or machine-level assembly, in order to run on the web. Of course, JavaScript wasn't designed for this and so performance was lacking.

In 2013 a solution to this problem was introduced by engineers at Mozilla, aptly named \inl{asm.js}. It restricts itself to the parts of JavaScript that can be optimized ahead-of-time \cite{Herman2014}. It might be used to compile a C/C++ program to the \inl{asm.js} target format to execute it faster with a JavaScript runtime than the equivalent JavaScript program would be. Benchmarks even showed it to run no more than 1.5x slower than native code \cite{Zakai2013}.

Finally, WebAssembly (Wasm) was born out of \inl{asm.js} in 2015, with more layers of optimizations. It is a portable and universal binary instruction format for memory-safe, sandboxed execution in a virtual machine.
It is possible to write programs in a variety of languages like C, C++, Rust, AssemblyScript, C\#, Go, Swift and many more, and compile them to Wasm, which finally relieves JavaScript of its role as the universal target format of the web \cite{W3C2020}.

% Since it is a bytecode format independent from JavaScript, it requires a separate runtime and sandboxing mechanism.

\subsection{Performance}

Compared to \inl{asm.js}, the Wasm binary format is smaller in size (10-20\%) and faster to parse, by an order of magnitude
\cite{Clark2019}. It is 33\% faster than \inl{asm.js} on average \cite{Haas2017}.
\citeauthor{NotSoFast} ran the PolyBenchC benchmark suite to compare Wasm to native code and found that 13 of the 24 benchmarks performed within 10\% of native code. However, they argue that the roughly 100 lines of code long benchmarks are not fully representative of typical use cases. They run the SPEC CPU benchmark suite, which are significantly larger POSIX applications. On average, they find Wasm to be slower than native by 1.55\times in Firefox and 1.45\times in Chrome \cite{NotSoFast}.
% Not representative, if we precompile to native code, but may be relevant if we choose to also evaluate the Wasm runtimes JIT modes
Wasm modules tend to be smaller than native x86-64 binaries. On average, Wasm modules have 85\% of the size \cite{Haas2017}.

Serverless functions, by design, are microservices and thus limited in scope. The PolyBenchC benchmark results are thus likely more representative than the SPEC suite.
To increase performance and startup time, Wasm modules can be compiled to native code, either by JIT engines at the time of execution, or ahead-of-time by the same JIT engines or AoT compilers. This process produces an artifact specific to the WebAssembly runtime that compiled it. At this point, the universality of the Wasm format is lost. Doing the translation to native code ahead-of-time means the compilation process does not take up time when we need to execute. Consequently, this is an interesting technique to reduce the time it takes to get a WebAssembly module ready for execution.

% How relevant is native speed actually for the serverless context -- examine in later chapter?

% The binary format is designed to allow streaming the contents, so that parts of it can be compiled even before the entire module has been transmitted. (but this is actually irrelevant for our OW implementation, since we have the init call first, in which the module is stored in a hashmap, and later the run call, where it is directly read from memory)


\subsection{Security}

% sandbox, memory-safety, linear memory, ...

Wasm defines two important goals for security.

\begin{quote}
    \quot{(1) protect users from buggy or malicious modules, and (2) provide developers with useful primitives and mitigations for developing safe applications, within the constraints of (1) \cite{W3C2020}.}
\end{quote}

To that end, Wasm uses fault isolation techniques to sandbox the executing module. Interaction with the host environment is only possible through imported functions \cite{W3C2020}. This mechanism represents a \quot{safe foreign function interface} as it can communicate with the outside environment, but not escape the sandbox \cite{Haas2017}.

In Wasm, all memory access is confined to a module's \emph{linear memory}. This memory is separate from the code space, which prevents programs from overwriting instructions. Programs can only operate in their own execution environment, but cannot escape. This means Wasm runtimes can safely execute multiple untrusted modules, with their own linear memories, in the same process memory space and without requiring additional isolation \cite{Haas2017}. In particular, »Reading and writing to arbitrary memory locations cannot be expressed in WebAssembly«, because Wasm's memory instructions work with offsets rather than addresses. Furthermore, bounds checking at runtime ensures the instructions write only to the linear memory \cite{Denis2019}.
This is a key aspect that enables Wasm as a lightweight container technology. Only a single instance of a runtime is needed to execute many (e.g. serverless) functions.

In the assembly produced by compiling a C program the call to a function is expressed as jumping to the address of the function's first instruction. In exploits of such programs, these addresses are often crafted or changed by malicious actors to take control of the program's control flow. In WebAssembly on the other hand, a function is represented as an index in a table, i.e. it introduces an additional level of indirection to express the address. That adds to security, since an arbitrary address to a Wasm function cannot be crafted with Wasm instructions \cite{Denis2019}. And since the program's memory is separate from the function instructions, an attacker also cannot overwrite them.
Wasm thus features control flow integrity, because it enforces structured control flow. Jump targets and other properties are validated in a single pass before a module is instantiated. In particular, validation prevents jumps from targeting arbitrary locations. This validation must happen, according to the Wasm spec, before a module is executed by a runtime \cite{Haas2017}.

With both performance and security under its belt as well as being a portable and universal target format, Wasm turns out to be useful not just in the browser, but also outside of it.

% http://wingolog.org/archives/2020/10/15/on-binary-security-of-webassembly
% Some of the criticism of Wasm security by "everything old is new again" is due to the fact, that C and C++ are simply not memory-safe. Shipping them as x86\_64 binaries compiled with a modern compiler, will add mitigations for these unsafeties. Wasm does not have those, so the vulnerabilities are once again exploitable. However, whether this is Wasm's fault is debatable. Wasm aims to be a universal target format. It does aim to enable C or C++ to run on the Web, similar to asm.js. However it is not the only language that was designed for.

% Rust has the concept of zero-cost abstractions. The concept can be boiled down to, if you don't use it, you don't pay for it (cite stroustroup or so). Early version's of the Rust language had green threads built-in, which was removed precisely for that reason. Similarly, Wasm should not introduce mitigations that every language would pay for, even if they are already memory-safe by design, like Rust or even Java. In this sense, it is not Wasm's responsibilty to fix the insecurities of C or C++.

\subsection{System Interface}

Wasm targets an abstract machine, so it needs an interface to the system. In the browser that works by calling into the browser through JavaScript glue code. Outside of it, a new solution was needed: The WebAssembly System Interface (Wasi). This interface was designed with Wasm's goals -- portability and security -- in mind.
Wasi is binary-compatible, so that Wasm binaries are portable between different concrete systems like Linux and Windows, but also browsers. The Wasm runtimes effectively implement that interface and translate it to the underlying concrete system.
Wasi also innovates in security, over the classic coarse-grained access control. It specifies a fine-grained capability-based security model, that consists of two parts. First, Wasi makes use of the aforementioned import mechanism of Wasm, to adhere to its security model. The Wasm module cannot directly call an OS system call due to sandboxing, but imports Wasi functions \cite{Clark2019}. For instance, a module that wants to open a file needs import statements like these:

% Change to `wat` after this PR has landed: https://github.com/pygments/pygments/pull/1564
\begin{minted}{python}
(import "wasi_snapshot_preview1" "fd_read" (func (;5;) (type 8)))
(import "wasi_snapshot_preview1" "path_open" (func (;7;) (type 22)))
\end{minted}

The runtime needs to supply those imports somehow, or the module cannot run. In effect, the runtime and module need to be in consensus about which functions can be accessed. In a serverless context for example, the cloud provider could grant or refuse access to certain functions, enabling security policies on a per-function basis. However, even that is not fine-grained enough. The cloud provider might only want to allow serverless functions to cache some data temporarily in the \inl{/tmp/} directory, but not allow opening \inl{\~/.ssh/id\_rsa}. This is where Wasi takes ideas from capability-based security.

In order to open a file, the module needs to call functions accessing the file, like \inl{fd\_read}, with a preopened file descriptor \cite{Clark2019}. The Wasm module then has the \emph{capability} to access \emph{that} file, but not others. The file can be opened by the runtime itself, or the program that embeds the runtime. They store that file descriptor in a special Wasi module which the runtime -- similar to a dynamic linker -- links to the Wasm module from where it imports the functions. Again, this gives the embedder, e.g. a cloud provider, the chance to customize the exact capabilities on a fine-grained level.

% Compare with docker in terms of sandboxing, security, system interface, performance, resource cost
% we can control access to resources as well -- at least memory (more research)

\subsection{Execution}

Just like Java Bytecode needs a JVM, Wasm needs a runtime as well. Since WebAssembly itself is just a specification, we need a concrete implementation to execute a module. There are many implementations available, the most used ones likely being those in the major browser JavaScript engines. However, since we don't need JavaScript support, we will use one of the standalone runtimes. Those come with different execution engines and goals. Wasm can be interpreted, just-in-time compiled or compiled to native code, ahead-of-time. All of these have different properties in terms of their cold-start latency as well as their runtime performance. We will discuss concrete runtimes in chapter \ref{chapter:design}.
