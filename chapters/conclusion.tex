"In principle, its scale-to-zeroproperty (i.e., unused containers are deallocated from the platform)suits very well energy-aware IoT use cases with intermittent ap-plications" \cite{Aslanpour2021}

-> Less cold start latency means less time keeping containers alive (mentioned in background - serverless workload).

Other attempts for speeding-up serverless have been successful, but didn't catch on. We assume this is due to custom-written application frameworks that aren't industry-proven. This is different in our case, since the public-facing interface that serverless developers need to interact with is WebAssembly, whose adoption rate is increasing.

\section{Open challenges}

- multi threading not in Wasm
- limiting CPU time (research if possible)
- limiting memory
