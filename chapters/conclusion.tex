"In principle, its scale-to-zeroproperty (i.e., unused containers are deallocated from the platform)suits very well energy-aware IoT use cases with intermittent ap-plications" \cite{Aslanpour2021}

-> Less cold start latency means less time keeping containers alive (mentioned in background - serverless workload).

\subsection{Open challenges}

- multi threading not in Wasm
- limiting CPU time (research if possible)
- limiting memory
