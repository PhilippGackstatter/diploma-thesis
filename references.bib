  abstract  = {Serverless computing platforms allow developers to host single-purpose applications that automatically scale with demand. In contrast to traditional long-running applications on dedicated, virtualized, or container-based platforms, serverless applications are intended to be instantiated when called, execute a single function, and shut down when finished. State-of-the-art serverless platforms achieve these goals by creating a new container instance to host a function when it is called and destroying the container when it completes. This design allows for cost and resource savings when hosting simple applications, such as those supporting IoT devices at the edge of the network. However, the use of containers introduces some overhead which may be unsuitable for applications requiring low-latency response or hardware platforms with limited resources, such as those served by edge computing environments. In this paper, we present a nomenclature for characterizing server-less function access patterns which allows us to derive the basic requirements of a serverless computing runtime. We then propose the use of WebAssembly as an alternative method for running serverless applications while meeting these requirements. Finally, we demonstrate how a WebAssembly-based serverless platform provides many of the same isolation and performance guarantees of container-based platforms while reducing average application start times and the resources needed to host them.},

  abstract  = {This paper considers how WASM can be run in different serverless contexts. A comparison of different serverside WASM runtime options is considered, specifically focused on wasmer, wasmtime and lucet. Next, different options for running WASM within two serverless platforms -- Openwhisk and AWS Lambdai -- are compared. Initial results show that a solution which uses the built-in node.js WASM supports is found to work better than using the dedicated WASM runtimes but this has limitations and providing more direct integration with WASM runtimes should be explored further.},

  abstract  = {The maturation of the Web platform has given rise to sophisticated and demanding Web applications such as interactive 3D visualization, audio and video software, and games. With that, efficiency and security of code on the Web has become more important than ever. Yet JavaScript as the only built-in language of the Web is not well-equipped to meet these requirements, especially as a compilation target.  Engineers from the four major browser vendors have risen to the challenge and collaboratively designed a portable low-level bytecode called WebAssembly. It offers compact representation, efficient validation and compilation, and safe low to no-overhead execution. Rather than committing to a specific programming model, WebAssembly is an abstraction over modern hardware, making it language-, hardware-, and platform-independent, with use cases beyond just the Web. WebAssembly has been designed with a formal semantics from the start. We describe the motivation, design and formal semantics of WebAssembly and provide some preliminary experience with implementations.},

  abstract  = {Born from a need for a pure “pay-per-use” model and highly scalable platform, the “Serverless” paradigm emerged and has the potential to become a dominant way of building cloud applications. Although it was originally designed for cloud environments, Serverless is finding its position in the Edge Computing landscape, aiming to bring computational resources closer to the data source. That is, Serverless is crossing cloud borders to assess its merits in Edge computing, whose principal partner will be the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. This move sounds promising as Serverless brings particular benefits such as eliminating always-on services causing high electricity usage, for instance. However, the community is still hesitant to uptake Serverless Edge Computing because of the cloud-driven design of current Serverless platforms, and distinctive characteristics of edge landscape and IoT applications. In this paper, we evaluate both sides to shed light on the Serverless new territory. Our in-depth analysis promotes a broad vision for bringing Serverless to the Edge Computing. It also issues major challenges for Serverless to be met before entering Edge computing.},
